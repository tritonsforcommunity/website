 <p>Green Streets projects engineer environmentally friendly devices to give out to the homeless to improve their quality of life. These projects include designing solar-powered water heaters, durable sleeping bags that double as solar energy sources, and sleeping bags that fold conveniently into jackets. Once the project ideas are fully developed, we will secure the funding and resources to make these projects hands-on.
