 <p>Red Cup is an awareness based application that prevents rape and abuse at college parties. Applications made for the Red Cup project will feature a help button to help bystanders rally support to prevent rape at parties and other social events. The app can also be used directly by individuals who feel threatened. Red Cup has two components, help and response. If you download the app, you will have the chance to give and receive help and prevent cases of rape and abuse.
