 <p>#GirlsLivesMatter creates applications for girls at risk of sex trafficking in San Diego. Modeled after the idea of <a href="http://www.amberalert.gov/">Amber Alerts</a>, which alerts the community in the case that a child is abducted in the area, and the existing SafeTrek app, these apps will give girls access to a help button 24/7, allowing them to alert the police and other people in the area if they feel threatened. #GirlsLivesMatter will prevent abductions in San Diego and save girls from living as victims of sex trafficking.</p>
